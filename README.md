# My personal dotfiles

I used to had nice dotfiles and lost them. Never again, here some of that awesomeness can be found.
It's not as great as some other dotfiles out there. But we'll get there someday.


## Install

```
git clone <repo_path> ~/Dotfiles
vi ~/Dotfiles/zshrc
... (change the path name and :wq)
ln -s ~/Dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
source .zshrc
```
